        <description><![CDATA[
        Syrax was a she-dragon of House Targaryen, known for her deep bond with Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, the “Realm’s Delight” and later the Black Queen during the Targaryen civil war, the Dance of the Dragons. Syrax was born and hatched in the early years of King Viserys I’s reign, likely around 103–104 AC. She was named after a Valyrian goddess and claimed by Rhaenyra at the age of seven. The dragon, golden-yellow in color with vibrant green eyes, grew quickly under Rhaenyra’s care and soon became her trusted mount. Although not as battle-experienced or fearsome as other dragons like Caraxes or Vhagar, Syrax was swift, powerful, and deeply bonded to her rider. She accepted no other rider throughout her life.

Rhaenyra and Syrax’s relationship was not only symbolic of the Targaryen's traditional Valyrian heritage but also a display of power. Syrax was often seen flying over King’s Landing and roosting in the Dragonpit, adding to Rhaenyra’s image as heir to the Iron Throne. She played a ceremonial role during the cremation of Queen Aemma Arryn and her son Baelon, where Rhaenyra commanded Syrax to breathe fire upon the funeral pyre—an act demonstrating her growing maturity and strength. Syrax also made a significant appearance when Rhaenyra flew to Dragonstone to retrieve a stolen dragon egg from her uncle Daemon, showcasing her loyalty and courage.

Throughout the years, Syrax laid multiple clutches of dragon eggs. Some of these eggs would later hatch into dragons that were bonded with Rhaenyra’s children. One egg produced Morning, a she-dragon later ridden by Rhaena Targaryen. This makes Syrax the matriarch of several dragons who participated in the Dance of the Dragons, further tying her legacy to the future of the Targaryen bloodline.

When the Dance of the Dragons broke out following King Viserys I’s death, Syrax became a powerful symbol of Rhaenyra’s claim. Although she was kept tethered in the Dragonpit for much of the war, her presence loomed large over King’s Landing. In 130 AC, tragedy struck during the Storming of the Dragonpit—a riot where a frenzied mob, driven by fear and religious hysteria, attacked and killed several dragons. Prince Joffrey Velaryon, one of Rhaenyra’s sons, attempted to ride Syrax despite not being her bonded rider. The dragon rejected him, flinging him to his death before being overwhelmed and slain by the mob. Despite her power, Syrax fell under the assault of hundreds of men who used ropes, spears, and fire to bring her down in a brutal and tragic end.

Syrax’s death marked a significant turning point in the Dance of the Dragons, symbolizing the fragility of Targaryen rule and the chaos of war. She died defending the legacy of her rider, a victim of the very people the Targaryens sought to rule. Her story, from hatching to her violent end, remains one of the most poignant and tragic among the dragons of Westeros.

        <name>Caraxes</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/caraxes.jpg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Caraxes, known as the “Blood Wyrm,” was one of the most fearsome dragons of House Targaryen during the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. He hatched from a dragon egg on Dragonstone around 72 AC and quickly earned a reputation for being both dangerous and exceptionally aggressive, even among young dragons. His striking appearance set him apart: Caraxes had blood-red scales, a long serpentine body, and bat-like wings with additional membranes on his hind limbs, giving him an almost eel-like form in flight. He also had sharp horns above his eyes and a snarling, high-pitched roar that made him especially terrifying on the battlefield.

Caraxes was first bonded to Prince Aemon Targaryen, King Jaehaerys I’s eldest son and heir to the Iron Throne. Together, they fought bravely in several battles, including the Fourth Dornish War and skirmishes on the island of Tarth. Caraxes was a deadly weapon in aerial combat, able to incinerate fleets and enemy soldiers with swift and fiery attacks. However, in 92 AC, during a campaign against the Myrmen on Tarth, Prince Aemon was killed by a crossbow bolt to the throat while Caraxes fed on goats nearby. The dragon returned to Dragonstone riderless and remained without a bonded companion for over a decade.

By 105 AC, Caraxes was claimed by Prince Daemon Targaryen, the rogue prince and younger brother to King Viserys I. This new partnership was as formidable as it was fiery. Daemon was a skilled warrior, ambitious, and rebellious—traits that matched well with Caraxes’ fierce temperament. The dragon and rider became symbols of power, feared across the Narrow Sea during the Stepstones campaign, where they burned pirate fleets and fortified Daemon’s claim to kingship over the Stepstones. Caraxes was utterly loyal to Daemon and played a vital role in his military successes, making them one of the most dangerous pairs in Westeros.

When the Dance of the Dragons erupted in 129 AC, Caraxes and Daemon fought for Rhaenyra Targaryen, Daemon’s wife, and Viserys I’s chosen heir. Caraxes participated in key battles during the civil war, showing brutal efficiency in aerial attacks. His most significant—and final—engagement came in 130 AC at the Battle Above the God’s Eye, where he faced the mighty dragon Vhagar, ridden by Prince Aemond Targaryen. In one of the most legendary dragon duels in history, Caraxes and Vhagar clashed high above Harrenhal. Despite being smaller and faster, Caraxes was gravely wounded. Both dragons eventually plummeted into the God’s Eye lake below.

Although mortally injured, Caraxes managed to drag himself out of the water before collapsing and dying on the shore. Daemon’s body was never found, and it is said he died during the fall or in combat atop Vhagar. Caraxes' death marked a turning point in the Dance of the Dragons, symbolizing not only the destruction of the Targaryens' might but also the tragic fate of their powerful dragons. Fierce, loyal, and unforgettable, Caraxes remains one of the most iconic dragons in Targaryen history.

        <name>Vhagar</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/vhagar.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Vhagar was one of the greatest and most fearsome dragons in the history of Westeros. She was born during the height of Old Valyria and brought to Westeros by Queen Visenya Targaryen during Aegon the Conqueror’s invasion. Alongside Balerion the Black Dread and Meraxes, Vhagar helped establish Targaryen dominance over the Seven Kingdoms. Named after a Valyrian god, Vhagar was the smallest of the three great dragons in the Conquest, but she still grew to an immense size—by the time of House of the Dragon, she was the oldest and largest living dragon in the world.

Vhagar’s first rider was Queen Visenya Targaryen, the sister-wife of Aegon I. Under her command, Vhagar burned castles, slew armies, and brought fire and blood to Westeros. After Visenya’s death, Vhagar went riderless for many years, living on Dragonstone and Dragonmont. In the early 120s AC, she was bonded with Laena Velaryon, a fiery and adventurous dragonrider and the daughter of Lord Corlys Velaryon and Princess Rhaenys Targaryen. Laena flew Vhagar across the Narrow Sea, even to Pentos, but tragically died in 120 AC after complications during childbirth. In a final act of strength, Laena commanded Vhagar to burn her alive rather than die in pain.

Shortly afterward, Vhagar was claimed by Prince Aemond Targaryen, the second son of King Viserys I and Queen Alicent Hightower. At the time, Aemond was a boy who had not yet bonded with a dragon, and he seized the opportunity to claim the mighty Vhagar after Laena's death, despite the danger. His daring flight and successful bond with her dramatically shifted the balance of power in the coming civil war, the Dance of the Dragons.

Throughout the Dance, Vhagar was a fearsome weapon of the Greens. At over 180 years old, she was massive—twice the size of younger dragons—and battle-hardened. She was instrumental in multiple battles, but her most infamous moment came during the tragic Battle Above Storm’s End. In a vengeful act against Princess Rhaenyra, Aemond pursued and attacked Lucerys Velaryon, Rhaenyra’s son, who rode the much smaller dragon Arrax. Ignoring Aemond’s commands, Vhagar savagely killed both Arrax and Lucerys in mid-air, beginning the true bloodshed of the war.

Vhagar’s final battle came in 130 AC at the Battle Above the Gods Eye. There, Aemond faced his uncle, Prince Daemon Targaryen, who rode the crimson dragon Caraxes. The two fought a deadly aerial duel over the Gods Eye lake. Caraxes latched onto Vhagar and bit deep into her neck, even as Vhagar tore Caraxes open. Daemon leapt from his saddle and drove his sword through Aemond’s eye before both he and Vhagar plummeted to their deaths. Vhagar’s colossal body lay at the bottom of the Gods Eye for centuries thereafter.

In the end, Vhagar’s death marked the loss of one of the last living connections to the Conquest era. She had outlived both her original rider and even many of her offspring’s descendants. Her immense strength, terrifying presence, and legendary legacy earned her a place in Westerosi history as the mightiest dragon of her age.

        <name>Meleys</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/meleys.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Meleys, known as the Red Queen, was a majestic and fearsome she-dragon of House Targaryen, famed for her scarlet scales and pink-tinged wing membranes. She was one of the fastest dragons of her time and a formidable presence during the Dance of the Dragons, the brutal Targaryen civil war. Meleys was considered one of the most beautiful and battle-ready dragons of the age. Her early history, while not extensively detailed, suggests she was hatched during the late reign of King Jaehaerys I or early in King Viserys I’s rule, placing her birth sometime before 90 AC.

Her first known rider was Princess Alyssa Targaryen, the daughter of Prince Aemon Targaryen. Alyssa was a dragonrider from a young age and flew Meleys during her short life. After Alyssa’s death in childbirth, Meleys remained riderless for a time before being claimed by Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, the daughter of Aemon and the so-called “Queen Who Never Was.” Rhaenys bonded with Meleys early in her adult life, and the two remained inseparable until their deaths. Meleys became Rhaenys’s primary mount and a symbol of her strength and defiance against the patriarchal traditions of Westeros.

By the time of the Dance of the Dragons, Meleys was one of the oldest and most experienced dragons alive. Despite her age, she was still incredibly swift—reputedly able to outpace even Caraxes and Vhagar in flight. Her rider, Rhaenys, played a key role in the Black Council, which supported Princess Rhaenyra’s claim to the Iron Throne after King Viserys’s death. Meleys and Rhaenys were part of the defense of Rook’s Rest, a crucial strategic location held by the Blacks in Crownlands.

Meleys’s most famous moment came during the Battle at Rook’s Rest in 129 AC. Queen Alicent Hightower and her greens planned a trap using the town as bait to lure Rhaenys and Meleys into open combat. When Rhaenys took flight to defend the keep, she was ambushed by both Vhagar, ridden by Prince Aemond, and Sunfyre, ridden by King Aegon II. Despite being outnumbered two to one, Meleys fought bravely. She managed to injure Sunfyre severely, burning him and knocking him from the sky. However, the combined assault proved overwhelming. Vhagar, the largest and most experienced dragon alive, tore into Meleys in mid-air, and both dragons crashed to the ground.

Meleys died in the fall, her body later found with her head nearly severed from her neck. Rhaenys was also killed in the battle, either from the fall or in the dragonfire that engulfed the battlefield. Her death marked a heavy loss for Rhaenyra’s forces, not just militarily but symbolically. The Red Queen had been a beacon of Targaryen might and matriarchal pride.

In summary, Meleys was a dragon of elegance, speed, and strength. From her early years with Alyssa to her final battle alongside Rhaenys, she represented a generation of noble dragons whose deaths ushered in the downfall of Targaryen supremacy. Her legacy lives on as one of the greatest dragons of the Targaryen dynasty.

        <name>Sunfyre</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/sunfyre.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Sunfyre, often called Sunfyre the Golden, was one of the most magnificent dragons in Targaryen history. Known for his radiant golden scales and imposing size, he was the personal mount of King Aegon II Targaryen, the son of Viserys I and Alicent Hightower. Born sometime before the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, Sunfyre played a pivotal role during this brutal conflict between Rhaenyra Targaryen and Aegon II for control of the Iron Throne.

Sunfyre was notable for his shimmering golden color, which made him stand out even among other dragons. His wings were pink-membraned, and in sunlight, his scales shone like molten gold. Considered one of the most beautiful dragons ever seen in Westeros, Sunfyre was young at the beginning of the Dance, but not small—he was a formidable force in battle, though less experienced than the older dragons like Vhagar or Caraxes.

Aegon II became Sunfyre’s rider before the Dance officially began. He flew the dragon during his coronation in 129 AC, held at the Dragonpit. This act, witnessed by many, was a statement of legitimacy and strength by the Green faction. Sunfyre and Aegon participated in several key battles during the civil war, including the decisive and destructive Battle at Rook’s Rest. There, Aegon II flew Sunfyre into battle alongside his dragonrider sister-wife Helaena (though she did not participate in the fight), and together they ambushed Princess Rhaenys Targaryen and her dragon, Meleys.

The battle turned into a brutal dragon duel. Though Sunfyre and Aegon were victorious, Meleys fought fiercely. Rhaenys and her dragon inflicted serious damage before being killed. Sunfyre was gravely wounded—his wing was torn, and he crashed to the ground. Aegon II himself was badly burned and nearly died. The injuries rendered Sunfyre unable to fly, and he was moved to Dragonstone to heal, albeit slowly.

While recovering, Sunfyre became vulnerable. After Dragonstone was taken by Rhaenyra’s forces, Sunfyre remained hidden, too injured to escape. However, in a shocking turn of events, he later emerged and killed the wild dragon Grey Ghost in the skies near Dragonstone. Despite still being wounded, Sunfyre demonstrated his ferocity and strength.

Eventually, Aegon II reclaimed his dragon. In one of the most brutal acts of the Dance, Aegon returned to Dragonstone in secret and ordered the execution of Rhaenyra Targaryen. Rhaenyra was thrown to Sunfyre, who devoured her in a horrifying scene of political vengeance and personal triumph.

Despite this gruesome victory, Sunfyre’s wounds never fully healed. His wing never regained full strength, and his ability to fly remained limited. After consuming Rhaenyra, he collapsed and grew weaker over time. Finally, in late 130 AC, Sunfyre died from his injuries. His corpse was later discovered near the remains of the Dragonmont.

Sunfyre’s life was a brilliant but tragic one. He symbolized both the glory and horror of Targaryen power: dazzling, deadly, and ultimately doomed. His loyalty to Aegon II and his role in killing Rhaenyra cemented his place in the history of the Dance of the Dragons, though his early death underscored the destructive cost of civil war.

        <name>Dreamfyre</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/Dreamfyre.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Dreamfyre was one of the most legendary dragons in the history of House Targaryen, known for her elegance, fierceness, and tragic end during the infamous Storming of the Dragonpit. A she-dragon of pale blue scales with silver markings and wings, Dreamfyre was born during the reign of King Aegon I Targaryen, around 32 AC. She was first bonded to Princess Rhaena Targaryen, the daughter of King Aenys I, making Dreamfyre one of the earliest dragons of the Targaryen dynasty following their conquest of Westeros. Rhaena claimed Dreamfyre at a young age, riding her for the first time when she was around twelve years old. The two shared a deep and lasting bond. Rhaena rode Dreamfyre during her travels and when defying King Maegor the Cruel. Dreamfyre was instrumental in maintaining Rhaena’s authority during this volatile period of Targaryen rule.

Dreamfyre was not only notable for her grace and speed in flight but also for her fertility. She laid many eggs throughout her life. Some of these eggs were kept at Dragonstone or gifted to noble houses, and a few were stolen. Notably, it is believed by some that the three dragon eggs stolen by Elissa Farman—later believed to have ended up across the Narrow Sea—eventually hatched into Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion centuries later for Daenerys Targaryen. Though unconfirmed, this theory adds another layer to Dreamfyre’s importance and legacy within Targaryen history.

After Rhaena’s death in 73 AC, Dreamfyre remained in the Dragonpit in King’s Landing. She stayed unbonded for some time until she was claimed by Princess Helaena Targaryen, the daughter of King Viserys I. Helaena, a gentle and sensitive soul, bonded with Dreamfyre but did not ride her into battle, unlike many other dragonriders during the Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. Their bond was quiet and emotional rather than militaristic. Dreamfyre, reflecting her rider's nature, stayed within the Dragonpit and did not participate in active combat during the early part of the war.

However, her end came tragically during the Storming of the Dragonpit in 130 AC. Following the death of Prince Joffrey Velaryon, the people of King’s Landing, incited by fear, religious fervor, and chaos, stormed the Dragonpit with the intention of killing the dragons. Dreamfyre, though chained, was able to break free and fought back fiercely. She killed hundreds of attackers and even shattered parts of the pit’s great dome. Unfortunately, she was ultimately brought down by a crossbow bolt that struck her in the eye. In agony, she flew upward and crashed into the collapsing dome, killing herself and dozens of people below. Her death was one of the most devastating moments of the Dance of the Dragons, symbolizing the dying power of House Targaryen and the tragedy of dragons forced into captivity and war. Dreamfyre’s legacy lives on through her riders, her eggs, and her role in the fall of the dragons.

        <name>Seasmoke</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/Seasmoke.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Seasmoke was a young, swift, and beautiful male dragon of House Targaryen, recognized by his pale silver-gray scales and agility in the air. Born during the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen, Seasmoke hatched on Dragonstone, the ancestral seat of House Targaryen, where many dragons were bred. Unlike the older and larger dragons like Vhagar or Caraxes, Seasmoke was comparatively smaller and leaner, which made him incredibly fast and maneuverable in flight—an ideal war-dragon during the Dance of the Dragons.

Seasmoke’s first known rider was Ser Laenor Velaryon, the son of Lord Corlys Velaryon and Princess Rhaenys Targaryen. Though not a Targaryen by name, Laenor was of Valyrian blood through his mother and thus able to bond with a dragon. Seasmoke and Laenor made their first known appearance during the Battle of the Stepstones, part of the conflict against the Triarchy. Laenor, alongside Daemon Targaryen on Caraxes, played a key role in this war by attacking from the air. Seasmoke was instrumental in turning the tide of the battle by burning enemy positions and warships from above.

Despite his strong bond with Laenor, the dragon was left without a rider when Laenor was presumed dead in 120 AC. However, in the show, House of the Dragon depicts Laenor faking his death and escaping across the Narrow Sea. In the book Fire & Blood, however, he truly dies, and Seasmoke remains riderless afterward. The dragon returned to Dragonstone, where he remained for a time, awaiting a new rider.

When the Dance of the Dragons began in 129 AC—a brutal civil war between Rhaenyra Targaryen’s supporters (the Blacks) and King Aegon II’s followers (the Greens)—Seasmoke was among the dragons available at Dragonstone. During this time, the Blacks sought new dragonriders to bolster their aerial forces. These dragonless Targaryen bastards, known as the “dragonseeds,” were encouraged to attempt to claim unbonded dragons.

Seasmoke was eventually claimed by Addam of Hull, one of the most notable dragonseeds. Addam was rumored to be the bastard son of Laenor Velaryon (though possibly Corlys’s son). He successfully mounted and bonded with Seasmoke, proving himself a capable dragonrider. Addam and Seasmoke played an important role in the civil war, particularly in the Battle of Tumbleton, a critical and chaotic confrontation in which betrayal and confusion reigned.

At Tumbleton, Addam initially fought alongside the traitorous “Two Betrayers”—Hugh Hammer and Ulf White—who had claimed the dragons Vermithor and Silverwing for the Blacks, only to betray Rhaenyra’s cause. Disgusted by their treachery, Addam turned against the betrayers. In a desperate act of loyalty to Rhaenyra, Addam and Seasmoke launched a surprise attack during the second battle of Tumbleton. Tragically, both dragon and rider were killed in the battle. Seasmoke died in aerial combat against the much larger dragon Vermithor, ridden by Hugh Hammer.

Though outmatched in size and strength, Seasmoke fought valiantly. In their final clash, both dragons died from their wounds or fell crashing to the earth. Addam’s heroic stand turned him into a tragic but noble figure, and Seasmoke died a symbol of loyalty and bravery.

        <name>Vermax</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/vermax.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Vermax was one of the young dragons hatched and bonded during the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen and later took part in the bloody Targaryen civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. He was a young male dragon, eventually bonded to Prince Jacaerys Velaryon, the eldest son of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Laenor Velaryon (though rumored to be fathered by Ser Harwin Strong). Vermax was smaller and younger than the older dragons like Syrax, Caraxes, and Vhagar, but he played a key role in the early stages of the civil war.

Vermax is believed to have hatched from an egg placed in Jacaerys’s cradle, following the Targaryen tradition of bonding dragons and riders from birth. Though his exact hatching date is not recorded, it would have been around 114 AC. As Jacaerys grew, so did Vermax, and by the time the Dance of the Dragons began in 129 AC, Vermax was large enough to be ridden and taken into battle. He was described as a young but spirited dragon, with greenish-bronze scales and wings.

When the war began after the death of King Viserys I, Vermax and Jacaerys became important figures in Rhaenyra’s Black faction. Vermax accompanied Jacaerys on diplomatic missions as a show of strength. Most notably, he flew with Jacaerys during his visit to the Vale, the North, and the Riverlands, securing allies for Rhaenyra’s cause. The presence of Vermax helped to intimidate lords into pledging support for Rhaenyra’s claim to the Iron Throne.

Tragically, Vermax met his end in the Battle at the Gullet, a major naval battle that took place near Dragonstone. In 130 AC, Jacaerys led a mission to repel the Triarchy fleet invading Blackwater Bay. During the battle, Vermax was deployed alongside other dragons to burn enemy ships and defend Dragonstone’s waters. However, the enemy had prepared for dragons, and many ships were equipped with scorpions—giant ballistae designed to kill dragons. Vermax was injured by these weapons and, in a moment of confusion or pain, is said to have dived into the sea near Hull. There, he either drowned or was killed. Some accounts suggest he was trapped beneath the waves by his wounds or struck by another projectile.

Prince Jacaerys, Vermax's rider, was also killed in the battle—he was either thrown from the dragon or leapt into the sea during Vermax’s descent. Neither of them survived. Their deaths marked a turning point in the war, as Rhaenyra lost her heir and one of her strongest symbols of Targaryen power. The death of Vermax illustrated the growing toll the Dance took on both dragons and their riders.

Though not the most powerful dragon, Vermax was a symbol of youthful strength and political promise. His death, like that of many dragons during the Dance, foreshadowed the downfall of the Targaryens and the end of the age of dragons in Westeros. His legacy lives on as a part of the tragic history that defined House Targaryen’s decline.

        <name>Arrax</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/arrex.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Arrax was a young male dragon of House Targaryen, born and bonded during the reign of King Viserys I. He was the personal mount of Prince Lucerys Velaryon, the second son of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and (officially) Laenor Velaryon. Like his brother Jacaerys’ dragon Vermax, Arrax was hatched from an egg placed in Lucerys's cradle, following the age-old Targaryen tradition of bonding dragons to royal children from birth. Arrax was smaller and younger than most of the dragons that fought in the Dance of the Dragons, including the ancient and massive Vhagar, but he played a pivotal role in one of the war’s most infamous and tragic events.

Arrax’s appearance was noted for his pearl-white scales and a relatively lean frame. He was not fully grown when the civil war began in 129 AC. As such, he was fast and agile in the air but lacked the raw size, strength, and battle experience of elder dragons. Despite this, he remained loyal to his rider, Lucerys, who called him “Arry” as a nickname in the House of the Dragon TV adaptation.

At the outbreak of the Dance of the Dragons, Princess Rhaenyra sent her sons across Westeros to rally support for her claim to the Iron Throne. Lucerys was sent to Storm’s End to gain the allegiance of House Baratheon. Arrax carried him swiftly through stormy skies to Lord Borros Baratheon's court. However, upon arriving, Lucerys discovered that Prince Aemond Targaryen, his uncle and bitter rival, had already arrived and was negotiating a marriage alliance on behalf of King Aegon II, Rhaenyra’s half-brother and rival claimant.

Tensions erupted in the Storm’s End hall when Aemond taunted Lucerys, demanding he remove an eye to repay the debt from their childhood fight. Lord Borros forbade bloodshed under his roof and allowed Lucerys to leave unharmed. But once Lucerys took to the skies on Arrax, Aemond followed on Vhagar, the largest and oldest living dragon in Westeros.

What followed was not a battle, but a chase in the sky during a fierce storm. Arrax, smaller and swifter, attempted to evade Vhagar among the storm clouds, using speed and maneuverability. At some point during the pursuit, Arrax defied Lucerys’s commands and attacked Vhagar with a burst of dragonfire. This prompted Vhagar, far more experienced and powerful, to retaliate. Whether Aemond lost control of her or allowed it to happen is debated, but Vhagar struck with overwhelming force, biting Arrax apart in midair.

Arrax and Lucerys both perished in the storm. Arrax’s body fell into the sea, and Lucerys’s body was never found, though some claimed pieces of the dragon and rider washed ashore days later. Their deaths marked the first bloodshed between dragonriders in the Dance of the Dragons, escalating the war into brutal territory and deeply fueling the hatred between the Black and Green factions.

Arrax’s end was a symbol of the innocence lost in war. A young dragon, barely grown, thrown into a conflict far beyond his years, he and his rider became martyrs of a doomed royal house’s civil war.

        <name>Moondancer</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/moondancer.jpg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Moondancer was a young and swift she-dragon of House Targaryen, bonded to Lady Baela Targaryen, the daughter of Prince Daemon Targaryen and Lady Laena Velaryon. Moondancer played a courageous but brief role in the Targaryen civil war, known as the Dance of the Dragons, and is remembered for her incredible speed, her fierce loyalty to Baela, and her heartbreaking death in combat.

Moondancer hatched during the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen. Her exact birth year is not recorded, but she was likely born between 118–120 AC, during Baela’s early childhood. Moondancer and Baela shared a strong bond, forged through Targaryen blood and Valyrian dragon-riding traditions. Like many dragonseeds, Baela was raised with a dragon egg placed in her cradle, and she bonded with Moondancer early in life. When the civil war broke out in 129 AC, Moondancer was still relatively young and small—comparable in size to a warhorse—but was known for her exceptional agility and grace in the air. She had pale green scales, pearlescent white horns and wing membranes, and was considered one of the most beautiful dragons of her time.

Baela, a fierce and strong-willed dragonrider like her father Daemon, was determined to defend her family’s cause during the Dance of the Dragons. She aligned herself with the Black faction, supporting her stepmother Rhaenyra Targaryen’s claim to the Iron Throne. In 130 AC, during the height of the conflict, Baela and Moondancer were stationed on Dragonstone.

Their most famous and final appearance came during the Second Battle of Dragonstone, when Ser Criston Cole, Hand of King Aegon II and a leading figure of the Greens, attempted a surprise assault on the island. However, it was not Cole who posed the real threat—it was Ser Aemond Targaryen, riding the monstrous dragon Vhagar. When Aemond attacked Dragonstone, Baela mounted Moondancer and rose into the sky to confront him, showing immense bravery despite the obvious mismatch between the two dragons.

The battle in the skies was brutal. Vhagar, over a century old and massive beyond compare, dwarfed the young Moondancer. Yet Moondancer’s speed and agility allowed her to dodge and harass Vhagar with quick strikes. She even managed to burn Aemond slightly and slash at Vhagar’s wings. But the power imbalance was too great. Eventually, Vhagar caught Moondancer and crushed her in her jaws. Moondancer was fatally wounded and crashed into the ground in flames. Baela survived the fall but was gravely injured—burned and broken. She would recover over time, but Moondancer was lost.

Moondancer’s death symbolized the tragic cost of the war, especially for the younger generation of Targaryens and their dragons. Her fight against Vhagar is remembered as an act of valor, with a young dragon and a determined girl daring to face the deadliest beast in Westeros. Though she perished, Moondancer’s courage inspired many who continued to fight in Rhaenyra’s name.

        <description><![CDATA[
        Vermithor, known as The Bronze Fury, was one of the largest and oldest dragons in Westeros during the events of the Dance of the Dragons. He was a massive male dragon with bronze scales and huge tan wings, rivaled in size only by Vhagar and Balerion the Black Dread. Vermithor was hatched during the early days of Targaryen rule, and his immense size and raw power made him a key weapon during the Targaryen civil war.

Originally, Vermithor was the mount of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, the longest-reigning king in Targaryen history. Jaehaerys rode Vermithor throughout his reign (48 AC to 103 AC), often using the dragon to display strength and suppress rebellion. Their bond was strong, and Vermithor was deeply respected as a war dragon and symbol of royal authority. After Jaehaerys’s death, Vermithor became riderless and made his home on Dragonstone, living without a rider for over two decades.

When the Dance of the Dragons broke out between Rhaenyra Targaryen (the Blacks) and Aegon II Targaryen (the Greens), Vermithor’s unmatched power became a crucial asset—if someone could claim him. Rhaenyra’s faction had more dragons than riders, so Prince Daemon Targaryen, Rhaenyra’s husband and one of the fiercest warriors in Westeros, called for dragonseeds—Targaryen bastards or those with Valyrian blood—to try to bond with the riderless dragons.

Vermithor was eventually claimed by Hugh Hammer, a blacksmith’s bastard with Valyrian ancestry. Hugh successfully bonded with Vermithor and quickly became a powerful figure in Rhaenyra’s army. However, his loyalty was shallow. After Rhaenyra captured King’s Landing, Hugh turned against her. Along with another dragonseed, Ulf White (rider of Silverwing), Hugh betrayed the Blacks, declaring himself king and demanding lands and titles. This betrayal marked a significant blow to Rhaenyra’s cause, as Vermithor now stood against her.

Later in the war, during the Battle of Tumbleton, Hugh and Vermithor joined the Greens in taking the town. Vermithor unleashed massive destruction on the battlefield—burning men, horses, and fortifications with his flame. However, Tumbleton soon descended into chaos. The betrayal of the dragonseeds caused tensions among the Green commanders, and disorder followed.

In the Second Battle of Tumbleton, Addam Velaryon, another dragonseed and rider of Seasmoke, launched a surprise attack on the traitors. A brutal dragonfight broke out. Vermithor, still one of the most fearsome dragons alive, fought viciously but was caught in a tangled midair battle with Seasmoke and the wild dragon Tessarion. All three dragons suffered grievous wounds. Seasmoke died, and Tessarion, wounded, collapsed shortly after. Vermithor was mortally wounded in the chaos, reportedly after being attacked on the ground by multiple enemies. Hugh Hammer was killed, either during the battle or soon after, ending his brief and infamous rise to power.

Vermithor’s death marked the end of one of the greatest dragons in Targaryen history. From the mighty mount of King Jaehaerys to the corrupted weapon of a traitor, his legacy spans peace, power, and the tragic destruction brought by civil war.

        <name>Sliverwing</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/sliverwing.jpg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Silverwing was a she-dragon of House Targaryen, known for her calm nature, silvery scales, and significant role in both the early Targaryen reign and the bloody civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. She was once the proud mount of Queen Alysanne Targaryen, the sister-wife of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen. Silverwing was one of the oldest and most well-known dragons of her time, second in fame only to Vermithor (Jaehaerys’s dragon) and Balerion.

Silverwing was born during the early years of Targaryen rule over Westeros, likely sometime around 20–30 AC. As a young dragon, she was bonded to Alysanne, who rode her on many diplomatic and political missions across the realm. Silverwing and Alysanne flew north to the Wall and were the first dragon and rider to visit Castle Black and the Night’s Watch. During this visit, Silverwing reportedly refused to fly north beyond the Wall, circling and turning back repeatedly—an incident that sparked centuries of speculation about the strange powers in the far north.

Alysanne and Silverwing remained closely bonded until the queen’s death in 100 AC. After Alysanne passed, Silverwing became riderless and lived freely on Dragonstone, nesting near the caverns and cliffs alongside other unclaimed dragons. She remained peaceful and unthreatening to the castle’s inhabitants, earning a reputation as a gentle and passive dragon—rare traits among the fire-breathing beasts.

When the Dance of the Dragons broke out in 129 AC between Rhaenyra Targaryen and Aegon II, both sides sought to recruit every dragon and potential rider available. Since more dragons than riders existed, Rhaenyra’s side offered unclaimed dragons to Targaryen bastards and those of Valyrian descent in a risky effort known as the “Calling of the Seeds.” During this event, Silverwing was claimed by Ulf White, a common-born man rumored to be a Targaryen bastard. He succeeded in bonding with her and rode her into battle.

Under Ulf White, Silverwing joined the Blacks and fought during the First Battle of Tumbleton, alongside Vermithor and Hugh Hammer. Although Silverwing remained less aggressive than other dragons, she still participated in the destruction of the town. However, soon after this battle, both Ulf and Hugh betrayed Rhaenyra’s cause and attempted to crown themselves kings. Ulf claimed royal blood and began acting like a drunken lord, while Silverwing remained largely passive through it all.

Eventually, during the Second Battle of Tumbleton, chaos erupted again. Ulf was poisoned by his supposed allies before he could betray them further, and Silverwing found herself riderless once more. During the battle, Silverwing became entangled in a dragon duel involving Vermithor, Seasmoke, and Tessarion. While she did not initiate the fight, Silverwing tried to flee or intervene. She survived the battle, though injured.

In the aftermath of the Dance, Silverwing outlived nearly every dragon who took part in the war. She was last seen roaming the wilds of Westeros, riderless but alive—possibly nesting in the Reach. Her peaceful nature and long life make her one of the few dragons remembered for restraint and endurance during a time defined by fire and blood.

        <name>Drogon</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/drogon.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Drogon was one of the three dragons hatched by Daenerys Targaryen, and the largest, most aggressive, and most closely bonded to her. Named after her late husband Khal Drogo, Drogon was distinguished by his black scales and red eyes and wings, making him resemble Balerion the Black Dread, the greatest dragon in Targaryen history. Of all the dragons in Game of Thrones, Drogon played the most prominent role, serving as Daenerys’s personal mount and the most fearsome creature in the series.

Drogon was hatched in the final episode of Season 1. After Khal Drogo’s death and the birth of her stillborn child, Daenerys placed three fossilized dragon eggs—gifts from Illyrio Mopatis—onto Drogo’s funeral pyre and walked into the flames. By dawn, she emerged unburnt, holding three newly hatched dragons: Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion. This miraculous event marked the rebirth of dragons in the world after over a century of extinction and solidified Daenerys as a true Targaryen heir.

As the dragons grew, Drogon quickly distinguished himself as the largest and most independent. He was the first to learn to hunt and the first to breathe fire with destructive precision. In Meereen, as Daenerys struggled to rule, Drogon became uncontrollable, eventually flying off on his own. During the Fighting Pits of Daznak, Drogon returned to rescue Daenerys from an assassination attempt and flew her out of danger, cementing their rider-dragon bond.

Drogon remained her primary means of travel and warfare. He was instrumental in Daenerys's conquest of Westeros, laying waste to enemy armies and fleets. Notable among his feats was his fiery devastation of the Lannister army in the "Loot Train Attack" (Season 7, Episode 4), where he destroyed a convoy returning from Highgarden. His presence on the battlefield was terrifying and overwhelming, making Daenerys's forces nearly unstoppable.

Despite his might, Drogon suffered wounds during combat. In the same battle, he was hit by a scorpion bolt fired by Bronn but recovered. His most painful moment came in Season 7, Episode 6, when Viserion was killed and reanimated by the Night King. Drogon, however, survived the attack and later helped deliver Daenerys to Winterfell to prepare for the final war.

During the Battle of Winterfell, Drogon fought against the undead and nearly perished when overwhelmed by wights. He fled temporarily but returned after the Night King's death. Drogon’s darkest moment came in Season 8, Episode 5 ("The Bells"), when Daenerys, consumed by grief and rage, used him to burn King's Landing—indiscriminately killing soldiers and civilians. Drogon rained fire on the city, destroying the Red Keep and cementing Daenerys’s tragic fall.

After Daenerys’s death at the hands of Jon Snow, Drogon’s grief was palpable. In a heartbreaking scene, he mourned her loss and melted the Iron Throne with dragonfire, perhaps understanding it as the source of her downfall. Then, in one of the show’s final moments, Drogon picked up her body and flew away into the east. His final destination is unknown, though Bran Stark later remarks that Drogon was last seen flying toward Volantis.

        <name>Rhaegal</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/rhagal.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Rhaegal was one of the three dragons hatched by Daenerys Targaryen, alongside Drogon and Viserion. Named in honor of Rhaegar Targaryen, Daenerys’s eldest brother who was killed during Robert’s Rebellion, Rhaegal was recognizable by his green scales, bronze-gold eyes, and yellow-green wing membranes. Though quieter and less aggressive than Drogon, Rhaegal was a powerful and loyal dragon, playing a vital role in Daenerys’s campaigns and the fight against the Night King.

Rhaegal was born in the fire of Khal Drogo’s funeral pyre at the end of Season 1. After Daenerys placed her three fossilized dragon eggs into the flames and walked into the fire herself, she emerged unscathed with three living baby dragons—something the world had not seen for over a century. From that moment on, Rhaegal and his brothers became central to Daenerys’s identity and power.

As a hatchling, Rhaegal was kept close to Daenerys, growing under her care as she rose in influence in Qarth, Slaver’s Bay, and later Meereen. Like his brothers, Rhaegal was trained to respond to her commands, especially the word “Dracarys” (Valyrian for "dragonfire"). Though Drogon often took the spotlight as her main mount, Rhaegal was no less significant and eventually matured into a full-grown dragon capable of devastating fire attacks and flight.

Rhaegal fought in several key battles. During the Battle of Meereen, he was freed from the catacombs beneath the Great Pyramid and joined Drogon in defending the city from the slaver fleet. Later, in Season 7, he traveled with Daenerys to Westeros, where he accompanied her to Dragonstone and helped in her military campaign. Though still unridden at the time, he patrolled with Drogon and Viserion, intimidating enemy forces.

His most important role came in Season 8, when Jon Snow, who was revealed to be Aegon Targaryen (the son of Rhaegar), was encouraged by Daenerys to ride him. Jon successfully mounted Rhaegal, marking the first time the dragon had accepted a rider—and establishing a symbolic connection between the dragon and the man named after his father.

Rhaegal fought bravely in the Battle of Winterfell against the Night King and his undead forces. He engaged in an intense aerial duel with undead Viserion, sustaining injuries but managing to survive and continue fighting. After the Night King was killed, Rhaegal recovered, though still visibly wounded.

However, his life came to a tragic and abrupt end in Season 8, Episode 4 ("The Last of the Starks"). While flying with Daenerys’s fleet toward Dragonstone, Rhaegal was struck by multiple scorpion bolts fired from Euron Greyjoy’s fleet, commanded by Queen Cersei Lannister. The first bolt pierced his shoulder, and a second struck his chest, causing him to fall from the sky. A final bolt punctured his neck, and he plummeted into the sea, dead.

Rhaegal’s death devastated Daenerys and left her with only one dragon—Drogon—for the final stages of the war. His sudden loss symbolized the high cost of war and the vulnerability of even the most powerful creatures in the world.

        <name>Viserion</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/viserion.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Viserion was one of the three dragons born to Daenerys Targaryen at the end of Game of Thrones Season 1. He was named in memory of Viserys Targaryen, Daenerys’s cruel older brother, though the dragon bore none of Viserys’s weakness. Viserion had cream-colored scales, golden eyes, and reddish-gold wing membranes, often described as the most majestic-looking of the three dragons. While not as dominant as Drogon or as heavily featured as Rhaegal, Viserion played a crucial role in the events of Westeros—especially in his shocking transformation by the Night King.

Like his brothers Drogon and Rhaegal, Viserion hatched from petrified dragon eggs given to Daenerys as a wedding gift. During the funeral pyre of Khal Drogo, Daenerys placed the eggs in the flames and walked into the fire herself. At dawn, she emerged unburnt with three baby dragons—Viserion among them—marking the magical rebirth of dragons into the world after more than a century of extinction.

As a hatchling, Viserion was cared for by Daenerys as a symbol of her rebirth and power. He was trained alongside his brothers and grew rapidly as she conquered cities in Slaver’s Bay such as Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen. Though Drogon became her preferred mount, Viserion was always nearby, loyal, and responsive to her commands, especially when ordered to burn enemies with her iconic command: “Dracarys.”

Viserion played a key role in the defense of Meereen, burning enemy ships alongside Rhaegal and Drogon during the slavers’ siege. He later accompanied Daenerys to Westeros, helping her enforce her claim to the Iron Throne.

However, Viserion's most shocking and pivotal moment came in Season 7, Episode 6 ("Beyond the Wall"). When Jon Snow and his group were ambushed by White Walkers and surrounded by undead, Daenerys arrived with all three dragons to rescue them. As she hovered above the frozen lake, the Night King hurled an ice spear at Viserion, piercing his neck. Viserion fell from the sky, crashed into the ice, and sank into the freezing water—apparently dead.

Later, in one of the show’s most dramatic twists, the Night King resurrected Viserion as an undead dragon. Now with pale, icy-blue eyes, and emitting blue flames instead of fire, Viserion was transformed into a terrifying weapon for the White Walkers. He was used to devastating effect in the final moments of Season 7, when he melted part of the Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, allowing the army of the dead to enter Westeros.

In the Battle of Winterfell (Season 8, Episode 3), undead Viserion battled his brothers, particularly Rhaegal, in a vicious aerial fight. Though wounded, Viserion continued to wreak havoc, tearing through the skies and breathing icy fire on Winterfell’s defenders.

Viserion met his end when Arya Stark killed the Night King. Upon the Night King’s death, the magic animating the undead—including Viserion—was broken. His body fell lifeless to the ground, ending his tragic arc as a dragon twisted by dark magic against the very world he was born to protect.

        <name>Tyraxes</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/tyrex.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Tyraxes was a young dragon bonded to Prince Joffrey Velaryon, the second son of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Laenor Velaryon (although his true father was likely Ser Harwin Strong). Though not as large or battle-tested as the older dragons like Caraxes or Vermithor, Tyraxes played a notable role in the escalating events of the Dance of the Dragons. His story is one of promise cut short by the brutality of war.

Tyraxes was born and raised on Dragonstone, where many Targaryen dragons nested. Like other dragons of his generation, Tyraxes hatched from an egg placed in the cradle of a noble Targaryen child—in this case, Joffrey Velaryon, around the early 120s AC. The practice of egg-cradling was a Targaryen tradition, intended to bond the dragon with the child from birth. This bond between Joffrey and Tyraxes matured naturally over the years, although Joffrey had not yet ridden the dragon in battle by the outbreak of the civil war.

Described in the books as a young but growing dragon, Tyraxes had begun developing wings strong enough for flight and had grown large enough to carry a rider, though he had not yet been tested in combat. He was about the same age as other dragons like Stormcloud and Morgul, part of a new generation of Targaryen dragons who were expected to serve future kings and queens.

When the Dance of the Dragons broke out in 129 AC, Prince Joffrey, like many of Rhaenyra’s children, found himself thrust into a violent succession war between his mother Rhaenyra and Aegon II. At the time, Tyraxes was kept on Dragonstone, where he remained throughout the early stages of the war.

Joffrey’s bond with Tyraxes was deep, but their relationship was cut short during the Fall of Dragonstone in 130 AC, when forces loyal to Aegon II seized the island. Joffrey, overwhelmed with grief after witnessing the brutal death of his older brother Prince Lucerys Velaryon and his dragon Arrax, attempted to fly Tyraxes in an act of youthful desperation and revenge—despite having no formal training or experience as a dragonrider.

Tragically, Joffrey’s attempt to mount and fly Tyraxes ended in disaster. As Tyraxes tried to lift off from Dragonstone’s courtyard under the unskilled command of his young rider, he panicked or became disoriented. The dragon took off but quickly lost control. Joffrey was either thrown from the saddle or fell to his death during the chaotic flight. His body was later recovered, broken on the rocks below the castle walls.

Tyraxes survived the fall but was later captured by enemy forces. Unlike other dragons who met violent ends in battle, Tyraxes was chained and imprisoned, though he eventually perished during the final stages of the war—either from starvation, mistreatment, or as part of the general dragon purge that followed the Dance.

        <name>Stromcloud</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/stromcloud.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Stormcloud was a young dragon born during the later years of King Viserys I Targaryen’s reign and bonded to Prince Aegon the Younger (later King Aegon III), the son of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and Prince Daemon Targaryen. As one of the youngest dragons during the Dance of the Dragons, Stormcloud’s story is brief but impactful, symbolizing the innocence destroyed by civil war and the terrible cost borne by the next generation.

Stormcloud hatched from an egg placed in the cradle of Prince Aegon upon his birth in 120 AC, in keeping with Targaryen tradition. This practice was meant to establish a lifelong bond between dragon and rider. Although the dragon was still young and relatively small at the outbreak of the civil war in 129 AC, Stormcloud had grown large enough to carry a rider—though barely.

Stormcloud had not yet seen battle when King Viserys I died, and the conflict over his succession—known as the Dance of the Dragons—erupted between Rhaenyra Targaryen (the “Black” faction) and Aegon II (the “Green” faction). Prince Aegon, Rhaenyra’s eldest surviving son from her second marriage, was still a boy of around nine years old when his life was upended by political violence.

The defining moment in Stormcloud’s life came during the Fall of Dragonstone in 130 AC. When Aegon II’s forces invaded Dragonstone and captured the stronghold, young Prince Aegon was hurriedly placed on Stormcloud’s back by his protectors in a desperate effort to escape. Though the dragon had never been ridden before, Stormcloud instinctively obeyed his bonded rider and took to the sky.

Despite his inexperience, **Stormcloud flew Prince Aegon all the way from Dragonstone to the island fortress of Dragonstone’s ally, presumably safety in the Vale or the Trident—accounts vary. The flight was heroic but not without cost. During the escape, Stormcloud was struck multiple times by enemy crossbow bolts or scorpion fire, depending on the source. Though wounded, he did not falter in the air and successfully brought Aegon to safety.

Unfortunately, the injuries Stormcloud sustained were too severe. After landing, the dragon collapsed from his wounds. Stormcloud died shortly thereafter, making him one of the youngest dragons to perish in the civil war. His death deeply affected Aegon, who had just experienced the terror of war, dragonback flight, and personal loss all at once.

Stormcloud’s sacrifice ensured the survival of Aegon the Younger, who would eventually ascend the Iron Throne as King Aegon III, also known as “Aegon the Dragonbane.” Ironically, although Aegon owed his life to Stormcloud, he grew to despise dragons after the war, presiding over the extinction of dragons in Westeros during his reign.

        <name>Tessarion</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/tessarion.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Tessarion, known as “the Blue Queen,” was one of the younger but most beautiful dragons of House Targaryen during the brutal civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons. She was bonded to Prince Daeron Targaryen, the youngest son of King Viserys I Targaryen and Queen Alicent Hightower, aligning her with the Greens, the faction supporting Aegon II Targaryen’s claim to the Iron Throne.

Tessarion was described as an exceptionally graceful and beautiful dragon. She had deep cobalt blue scales, copper-colored eyes, and flames that shone a brilliant blue when she breathed fire. Her wing membranes were a lighter blue, giving her an ethereal appearance in flight. Despite being relatively young—likely around 9 or 10 years old at the start of the Dance—she was large enough to carry her rider into battle and played a major role in several key conflicts.

Prince Daeron Targaryen, nicknamed Daeron the Daring, bonded with Tessarion in his youth. While not as famous or feared as Caraxes or Vermithor, Tessarion proved herself a courageous and deadly dragon. Daeron and Tessarion were stationed in Oldtown early in the war, and their arrival turned the tide of battles in the Reach. Daeron's first major contribution was in the Battle of the Honeywine, where Tessarion helped secure victory for the Greens by burning the Black army and forcing their retreat.

As the war escalated, Tessarion continued to fly alongside other Green dragons like Sunfyre and Vermithor, playing a supporting but critical role. Her speed, agility, and the brilliant spectacle of her fire made her stand out on the battlefield. Though not the most massive of dragons, she was among the most maneuverable and elegant in the skies.

Tragically, Tessarion’s fate became intertwined with the chaos and bloodshed that defined the final stages of the Dance. After the fall of Rhaenyra and the devastation of King’s Landing, the war continued in the form of guerrilla resistance and brutal dragon-on-dragon violence.

In 130 AC, after the deaths of both Aegon II and Rhaenyra’s major supporters, a final Green stronghold at Tumbleton was attacked. During this time, Tessarion flew alongside Hugh Hammer, a dragonseed who had claimed the mighty Vermithor. But loyalties grew confused, and infighting led to disaster.

In the Second Battle of Tumbleton, Tessarion fought in the sky against Seasmoke, the dragon of the Black-aligned Addam Velaryon, and Vermithor, who had turned on Hugh Hammer’s former allies. In the chaos, all three dragons fought violently. Tessarion was gravely wounded—pierced through by Seasmoke and Vermithor’s claws and fire.

Though she survived the initial clash and crash-landed, she was fatally injured. According to some accounts, she lay dying for hours, unable to move. It is said that a crossbowman eventually put her out of her misery, weeping as he did so, moved by the dragon’s beauty and suffering.

        <name>Sheepstealer</name>
        <image>assets/images/dragons/sheepstealer.jpeg</image>
        <description><![CDATA[
        Sheepstealer was a wild dragon who lived on Dragonstone during the Targaryen dynasty but was never tamed by a royal dragonrider—until the rise of the dragonseeds during the Dance of the Dragons. Unlike noble dragons raised with Targaryen princes and princesses, Sheepstealer was born wild and remained unbonded for most of his life, feared by smallfolk and dragonriders alike.

Sheepstealer earned his name due to his unusual habit of preying almost exclusively on sheep. For decades before the civil war, he dwelled in the eastern slopes of Dragonstone, often stealing sheep from pastures and villages. Though he rarely harmed humans unprovoked, he was considered dangerous, elusive, and untamable, known for his shyness around people and his tendency to flee rather than fight—unless cornered.

Unlike legendary dragons such as Balerion or Vermithor, Sheepstealer was never ridden by any Targaryen prince. His scales were described as muddy brown and green, ideal for blending into the terrain of Dragonstone. He was considered a middle-aged dragon during the Dance—larger and stronger than newly hatched dragons, but smaller and less powerful than the great beasts of old.

During the Dance of the Dragons, Rhaenyra Targaryen’s side (the Blacks) desperately sought new dragonriders to strengthen their forces. This led to the calling of dragonseeds—bastards and commoners with supposed Valyrian blood—to try and tame unclaimed dragons. Many died attempting this, but a brave and clever girl named Nettles succeeded in taming Sheepstealer.

Nettles, a bastard girl of uncertain origin (believed to be the daughter of a dragonkeeper or Targaryen lowborn), approached Sheepstealer differently than others. Instead of attempting to mount him outright, she left sheep for him every morning, feeding him consistently and earning his trust. Eventually, she was able to mount him and became his rider—the only person ever to do so.

With Nettles as his rider, Sheepstealer fought for the Blacks, although he did not see as many battles as dragons like Caraxes or Syrax. Nettles and Sheepstealer became valuable assets, particularly as scouts and raiders in the Riverlands. However, late in the war, political intrigue and paranoia arose. Rhaenyra, driven by suspicion, accused Nettles of treason and ordered her killed—possibly due to jealousy over rumors of an affair between Nettles and Prince Daemon.

Warned of the plot, Nettles fled Dragonstone on Sheepstealer before she could be captured. They vanished into the Mountains of the Moon in the Vale, evading pursuit. Neither Sheepstealer nor Nettles were ever seen again—at least officially.

Legends later arose among the mountain clans of a brown dragon living in the highlands, seen occasionally with a dark-haired woman rider. These tales suggest that Nettles and Sheepstealer may have survived for years, hidden from the aftermath of the Dance and the decline of the dragons.

    <name>Cannibal</name>
    <image>assets/images/dragons/cannibal.jpeg</image>
    <description><![CDATA[
    Cannibal was a legendary wild dragon who lived on Dragonstone during the Targaryen dynasty. Known for his savage behavior, massive size, and terrifying appetite, Cannibal was feared by dragons and humans alike. He was never tamed or ridden, and no serious attempt was ever made to claim him due to his violent nature.

Cannibal earned his chilling name because he was said to feed on the corpses of dead dragons, dragon eggs, and even newly hatched hatchlings—a behavior no other dragon was known to exhibit. His cannibalistic tendencies made him a threat even to other dragons and dragonkeepers, and he was both shunned and avoided by the Targaryens.

No official record exists of Cannibal’s hatching, but he was already living on Dragonstone when Aegon the Conqueror arrived, suggesting that he may have been born during the early days of Valyria or even before the Targaryen migration. Some believed he was a wild native dragon of Dragonstone itself, possibly older than Balerion the Black Dread, although that remains speculation. What is certain is that Cannibal was extremely old, enormous, and one of the largest living dragons during the Dance of the Dragons.

Cannibal had jet-black scales, matching his reputation, and glowing green eyes. He lived in isolation in a cave on the northeastern face of Dragonstone, a region avoided even by other dragons. The dragonkeepers steered clear of him, and the royal family never attempted to bond him with a Targaryen child. Even other wild dragons like Sheepstealer and Grey Ghost avoided his territory.

During the Dance of the Dragons (129–131 AC), as both sides desperately tried to claim every available dragon, the Blacks issued a call for dragonseeds to tame the riderless beasts. Many commoners and bastards with Valyrian blood attempted to mount dragons like Seasmoke or Vermithor, but no one dared try to tame Cannibal. His violent reputation—known to kill both dragons and humans alike—made him untouchable. Anyone foolish enough to approach him likely perished, as no account exists of anyone surviving an encounter.

Cannibal did not participate in any battles during the civil war, nor did he appear to align with any faction. Instead, he remained a wild, chaotic force, looming in the background as a symbol of uncontrollable fire and fury. He likely fed on the carcasses of dragons killed in battle, especially during the later stages of the war, when Dragonstone and other areas became dragon graveyards.

After the Dance of the Dragons ended and Aegon III took the throne, dragonkind rapidly declined. Most of the dragons either died in the war or shortly after. Cannibal's fate is unknown. He simply vanished from history. Some believe he fled Dragonstone or was eventually killed in secret. Others suggest that he may have lived for decades afterward, hiding in remote caves or flying across the Narrow Sea.

    <name>Grey Ghost</name>
    <image>assets/images/dragons/greyghost.jpeg</image>
    <description><![CDATA[
    Grey Ghost was a wild and elusive dragon that made his lair on Dragonstone but remained completely unclaimed throughout his life. Unlike the more aggressive and infamous wild dragons such as Sheepstealer or Cannibal, Grey Ghost was known for his shy nature, avoidance of people, and a peaceful disposition that made him an outlier among his kind.

Grey Ghost earned his name from his pale grey-white scales, which allowed him to blend effortlessly into the foggy mists and rocky cliffs of Dragonstone. Because of his coloring and reclusive behavior, he was rarely seen and almost never up close. The dragonkeepers of Dragonstone named him “Grey Ghost” because sightings of him were so brief and fleeting—he was said to appear like a ghost in the mist and disappear just as quickly.

Unlike Sheepstealer, who actively stole livestock, or Cannibal, who devoured other dragons, Grey Ghost avoided both humans and other dragons. He never attacked villages or livestock, and there are no records of him killing any humans. He was known to feed primarily on fish, which he caught by diving into the sea, and was often seen flying low over the narrow sea between Dragonstone and Driftmark.

At the time of the Dance of the Dragons (129–131 AC), Grey Ghost was one of three riderless dragons on Dragonstone, alongside Sheepstealer and Cannibal. As Rhaenyra Targaryen’s Black faction grew desperate for more dragonriders, they issued a call for dragonseeds—those of Valyrian descent but low birth—to try and tame the unclaimed dragons.

While many attempted to claim Seasmoke, Vermithor, or Silverwing, no one tried to claim Grey Ghost—not because he was dangerous, but because no one could find him. He never came near people, kept to remote caves, and vanished for weeks or even months at a time. His elusiveness saved him from being forced into war, but it also ensured that he would never play a role in the conflict.

Grey Ghost’s fate took a tragic turn near the end of the Dance of the Dragons. In 130 AC, during the fall of Dragonstone, a dragonseed named Hugh Hammer had claimed Vermithor, one of the largest and most powerful dragons alive. As chaos erupted and alliances shifted, Hugh Hammer became a threat even to his former allies.

It was during this time that Vermithor killed Grey Ghost, mistaking him for a threat or simply attacking out of dominance. The encounter was entirely one-sided—Grey Ghost was no match for the colossal Vermithor and was slain in what was likely his first and only combat encounter. The gentle, reclusive dragon died without ever harming a soul or taking a rider.
